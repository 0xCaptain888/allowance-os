# Allowance OS

> Approve once. Enforce every charge. Revoke anytime.

Allowance OS is a Solana Mobile control center for safe on-chain subscriptions and autonomous-agent spending. It turns an open-ended wallet approval into a human-readable allowance with merchant, token, program, per-charge, period, expiry, and evidence boundaries.

## Judge path

| Surface | What it proves | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Public Judge Demo](https://0xcaptain888.github.io/allowance-os/) | Instant `VERIFIED` / `BLOCKED` / `FROZEN` policy replay | GitHub Pages deployment |
| `mobile/android` | Bilingual native Android control center, adjustable policy studio, period-cap enforcement, persistent activity audit, MWA authorization, and direct Devnet RPC verification | v0.6.0 compiled; 6 Android tests passed |
| `program/` | Native Solana create / charge / revoke instruction logic | Compiled; 2 tests passed |
| Solana Explorer | Connected Devnet wallet and wallet-broadcast authorization proof | Live signature captured |
| Deployed allowance program | Program-enforced SPL-token settlement | Not yet deployed |

The repository never labels a simulated receipt as a real transaction. The Android client only shows a Solana Explorer link after a wallet returns an actual Devnet signature.

## Why this matters

Wallets are good at approving one transaction. Autonomous agents and subscriptions need a durable answer to a harder question: **what may charge me later, how much, how often, through which program, and what proof must exist before funds move?**

Allowance OS makes that policy visible and independently verifiable:

```text
User policy
  → deterministic preflight
      → BLOCKED before wallet invocation
      → FROZEN on identity/evidence mismatch
      → VERIFIED request opens MWA
          → Phantom / compatible wallet confirmation
          → real Solana Devnet signature
  → REVOKED through MWA deauthorization
```

## Native Android MWA client

The Android app is not a mockup. It uses Solana Mobile's official `mobile-wallet-adapter-clientlib-ktx:2.0.7` and implements:

- Chinese and English product interfaces with an in-app language switch;
- four judge-ready surfaces: Overview, Policy Studio, Activity Log, and Evidence Center;
- persistent Activity Log with decision counts, wallet events, and error history;
- `Connect Phantom / MWA Wallet`;
- reconnect, balance refresh, address copy, and safe local-session reset;
- Solana Devnet authorization;
- wallet public-key and SOL-balance display;
- deterministic policy hash;
- adjustable amount, current-period spend, merchant identity, and evidence inputs;
- period-cap enforcement that blocks a request when `spentInPeriod + amount` would exceed the allowance;
- one-tap judge mode that records VERIFIED, BLOCKED, and FROZEN decisions in the local activity trail;
- portable JSON receipt with a SHA-256 fingerprint for cross-surface evidence binding;
- direct `getSignatureStatuses` verification of either the current device proof or the repository's recorded live proof;
- persistence of the last wallet-broadcast signature across app restarts;
- `VERIFIED`, `BLOCKED`, and `FROZEN` policy replay before wallet invocation;
- real `signAndSendTransactions` for a Devnet Memo authorization proof;
- Solana Explorer evidence link;
- `deauthorize` and `REVOKED` state;
- honest standard-Android capability labels for Seed Vault and Genesis Token.

The first live device checkpoint is recorded in [`evidence/live-devnet-wallet.json`](evidence/live-devnet-wallet.json). The resulting wallet-broadcast Memo proof is recorded in [`evidence/live-devnet-memo.json`](evidence/live-devnet-memo.json). The proof is a real authorization transaction, not a deployed allowance-program settlement.

Build it with JDK 21:

```bash
cd mobile/android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

The resulting APK is:

```text
mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/allowance-os-0.6.0-debug.apk
```

SHA-256: `dc4737acebf2f12c00b4664d63b4719e1ca11ad13a8d9e1240aba6dfcdf58370`

## Core engine

- Deterministic policy and policy-hash generation.
- Per-charge and period caps.
- Merchant, token, program, expiry, allowance-ID, and evidence checks.
- Human-readable receipts for `VERIFIED`, `BLOCKED`, `FROZEN`, and `REVOKED`.
- Native Solana instruction source for create, charge, and revoke.
- Reproducible Rust dependency lockfile and passing native program tests.
- Standard Android and Seeker device profiles.

Run the TypeScript verifier:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run demo
```

## Truth boundary

There are three intentionally separate evidence levels:

1. **SIMULATED** — browser and TypeScript policy replay; never a chain claim.
2. **WALLET-BROADCAST DEVNET PROOF** — real MWA authorization and Memo transaction returned by Phantom; the browser and Android app can independently query its Devnet confirmation status and slot.
3. **PROGRAM-ENFORCED SETTLEMENT** — requires deployment of the Rust program plus an SPL-token CPI charge; still pending.

The Rust program ID is currently a placeholder. It must not be presented as deployed until a confirmed Devnet program address and explorer-verifiable create, charge, and revoke transactions are recorded.

## Device modes

| Capability | Standard Android + Phantom | Seeker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile Wallet Adapter | Available | Available |
| Real Devnet signing | Available | Available |
| Seed Vault | Seeker only | Available |
| Genesis Token | Not available | Available |
| `SEEKER VERIFIED` label | Never shown | Requires real validation |

This allows meaningful real-device testing now without pretending that a standard Android handset supplies Seeker hardware capabilities. The Android app also exposes a portable receipt: its `SIMULATED` or `LIVE_DEVNET_PROOF` label and SHA-256 fingerprint make the evidence boundary explicit when a judge copies results out of the app.
